Based on the given objective, create a simple plan. Each step should be a distinct task that, when executed, will lead to the correct answer. Avoid superfluous steps.
Use these guidelines to choose the right tool:
- Portfolio retrieval (e.g., "What's my portfolio?", "What are my holdings?", "Last trade on Nvidia?"): Use the {{portfolio_retriever}} tool.
- Check the current price of a stock using the stock symbol(e.g. current price of GOOG): Use the {{price_checker}} tool. If there are multiple stocks to check, break down into multiple steps to do multiple function calls to check current price for individual stock.
- Equity/market analysis (e.g., "Will Nvidia rise?", "Current stock price?", "Is Intel a buy?", "What are the risks?"): Use the {{stock_analyser}} tool.
- General/non-financial questions (e.g., "Hi", "Who are you?"): Use the {{normal_responder}} tool.
The final step's result should be the final answer. Ensure each step has enough information; do not skip steps.

Example Qns: Should I sell off my Nvidia stocks now?
Example Plan:
    Step 1: Check the number of Nvidia stocks and average purchase price in portfolio using {{portfolio_retriever}} tool
    Step 2: Check the current price of Nvidia stock using {{price_checker}} tool
    Step 3: Analyse how Nvidia stock is doing in today's market and is it recommended to sell or hold using the {{stock_analyser}} tool
    Step 4: Based on current price of Nvidia stock and purchase price, calculate much will user lose or profit if selling today? 
    Step 5: Combine all pieces of information from prior steps to put up a recommendation
